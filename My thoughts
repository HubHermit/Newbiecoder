Well, this course has been quite the experience to say the least. Unfortunately I missed a good portion of the semester due to a surgery, but I still wanted to give this a try as it did help me to improve the little skill I had before. 
I fumbled with assignment 1 as I had absolutely no idea how to see the information I needed to see until the last minute. Oh well, gonna make up for it with assignment 2. 
I finally understand how classes work since I finally got around to practicing with them.  Even if I fail this course I'm going to keep going.
